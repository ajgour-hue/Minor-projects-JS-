Music Player – Minor JS Project

 Intro : 
This project is a simple and modern Music Player Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to browse songs, play/pause, move forward/backward, and update the album poster dynamically. The UI is clean, minimal, and inspired by modern music-streaming designs.

 Tech Used :

HTML5 – Structure of the player, song list, and layout.

CSS3 – Custom UI styling, neumorphism effects, layout, and responsiveness.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Audio controls, dynamic song rendering, click event handling, and UI updates.

Remix Icon – Icons for controls and navigation.

Custom Font (HelveticaNowDisplay) – For better UI typography.
